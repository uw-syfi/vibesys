# Radix / prefix caching

Keep the KV cache of committed prefixes alive and reuse it for new requests that share a prefix. Matching is a radix-tree lookup keyed on token IDs. For workloads with high prefix overlap (RAG, few-shot, agent trees) the win on TTFT is dramatic.

## Concept

- **Radix tree node** = chunk of tokens with a pointer to the KV cache pages for those tokens.
- **Edge** = next-token ID (or token chunk).
- On a new request: walk the tree matching the prompt token-by-token; reuse matched pages; allocate and link new pages for the divergent suffix.
- **Reference counting**: nodes in use by a live request can't be evicted.
- **Eviction**: LRU over unreferenced nodes; freed pages return to the block pool.

Match granularity matters:

| Granularity | Pros | Cons | Used in |
|:-----------|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| Token-level | Maximum hit rate | More bookkeeping | SGLang RadixAttention |
| Block-level (`block_size`) | Simpler, aligns with paged layout | Misses partial-block overlap | vLLM APC, TRT-LLM KV reuse |

## Diagnose cached-output divergence

Separate cache corruption from batch-shape-sensitive greedy numerics before
rewriting KV storage:

1. Run cached and uncached requests with the same physical batch composition,
   graph bucket, cache length, positions, and attention backend.
2. Run two uncached copies at the differing serial/concurrent batch shapes.
3. Locate the first divergent token; record the top-1/top-2 logit margin there,
   plus cache-length, position, page-table, and live-KV hashes before decode.

Interpret the matrix:

| Matched-shape cache A/B | Uncached shape A/B | Likely cause |
|:--|:--|:--|
| diverges | matches | cache key, KV layout, length, position, or synchronization defect |
| matches | diverges | BF16 kernel / graph-bucket numerical sensitivity near an argmax tie |
| diverges | diverges | mixed failure; isolate the first divergent decode input before changing storage |

Do not infer cache corruption solely because a serial fresh request and a
concurrent cached request produce different greedy text: physical batch shape
can change BF16 reduction order and flip an argmax with a small logit margin.
Likewise, do not “repair” the cache by copying padded pages or changing its
representation unless matched-shape KV/hash evidence identifies a layout or
stale-byte mismatch. Keep cache-equivalence checks distinct from any stronger
product policy that demands batch-invariant output.

## Hierarchical tiers (HiCache / offload)

**Applies to: `cuda`, `rocm`.** This section assumes a discrete device pool
that is smaller than host RAM. Under unified memory (`metal`) there is no
GPU→CPU tier — it is the same physical memory — and on `cpu` the first tier is
already host RAM. The radix matching above is portable; only this ladder is not.

When device-resident cache isn't enough, tier outward:

```
GPU HBM (fastest, scarce)
     ↓ (evict / restore)
CPU RAM (larger, slow)
     ↓
NVMe / disk (huge, very slow)
     ↓
object store (unbounded, remote)
```

On a prefix match whose pages have been evicted to a lower tier, the scheduler either (a) fetches them back before computing attention, or (b) recomputes. Fetching is usually a win for long prefixes; recomputing is better for short ones. Implementations maintain a cost model.

Under unified memory generally (the `unified-memory` property: `metal`, and unified-memory SKUs on other backends such as MI300A-class APUs on `rocm`), the same reasoning applies: host and device share one pool, so there is nothing to tier outward to. Radix matching and reuse are unaffected; only the eviction ladder is inapplicable.

Status: verified. Public property of unified memory (shared host/device pool); 2026-09-05.

## Compatibility

| Implementation | Engine | Granularity | Tiers | Notes |
|:---------------|:-------|:------------|:------|:------|
| RadixAttention | SGLang | token | GPU | default, always on |
| HiCache (radix + tiered) | SGLang | token | GPU → CPU → disk → object store | `hiradix_cache.py`, `hicache_storage.py` |
| Automatic Prefix Caching (APC) | vLLM | block | GPU | enabled by flag |
| KV cache reuse | TensorRT-LLM | block | GPU (CPU offload in progress) | |
| HiCache / offload tier ladder | SGLang | token | **N/A** under `unified-memory` | host and device share one pool (e.g. MI300A-class APUs); radix matching and reuse work unchanged, only the GPU-to-CPU-to-NVMe eviction ladder is inapplicable |

## Retention policy (priority-aware eviction)

Plain LRU treats all unreferenced blocks equally. That's wrong when some prefixes are system prompts, few-shot demonstrations, or expensive-to-recompute tool outputs that you *know* you'll re-hit. TRT-LLM's `KvCacheRetentionConfig` lets a request tag token ranges with priority 0–100 and an optional TTL, changing the eviction order:

- Blocks carry a priority in `[0, 100]` (default **35**). Eviction always drains the lowest non-empty priority tier first, LRU within the tier. Higher-priority blocks are never evicted until every lower-priority block is gone.
- `TokenRangeRetentionConfig(token_range_start, token_range_end, priority, duration_ms)` applies to **input tokens only** — e.g. "tokens 0–1024 are priority 90 for 60 s, then revert to 35".
- `decode_retention_policy` and `decode_duration_ms` cover the generated portion.
- With host offload enabled (`host_cache_size`), `secondary_offload_min_priority` (default 35) gates whether an evicted block is copied to CPU or dropped outright. Low-priority blocks skip offload and save CPU↔GPU bandwidth.

When it matters: long system prompts in a chat serving tier, RAG with hot retrieval shards, agent workflows that re-enter the same tool prompt. Give those blocks ≥ 50 priority; everything else keeps the default of 35.

## Multimodal cache keying

Image / audio tokens look like placeholder IDs but carry modality-specific KV state. Match two policies:

- **Content hash (default).** Hash the bytes of the image/audio and use that as the cache key for the corresponding token span. Stable across sessions; requires re-hashing on every request.
- **Caller-supplied UUID.** Pass `multi_modal_uuids` alongside `multi_modal_data`. TRT-LLM then keys on `BLAKE3(UUID ‖ content)` — combining both prevents cache collisions when two callers happen to pick the same UUID string, while still letting the caller reuse a stable ID across sessions. The UUID (not the content hash) is what appears in KV cache events, so external cache directories stay human-readable.

Without UUIDs, there is no cross-session hit because each new request re-hashes the content with a different salt; with UUIDs, there is — at the cost of trusting the caller not to reuse a UUID on *different* content (which the `‖ content` defends against).

## Interaction with other features

- **Speculative decoding**: verify rewinds can invalidate a suffix of the committed prefix; the cache must handle "un-commit" correctly, or be conservative about what's shared.
- **Tool calling / branching**: each branch shares the prompt prefix; radix sharing is exactly the right model.
- **Multi-turn conversations**: each turn shares the history; prompt caching matters more as conversations grow. On a multi-turn chat workload the prior turns' generated tokens are already committed in the tree, so a turn-2+ request should prefill only the new user message; whether this holds must be verified per deployment (tokenizer, chat template, and eviction pressure vary). Scope: multi-turn chat serving, engine-agnostic. Status: candidate, unverified in the campaign that surfaced it; sglang-v0.5.18-rocm700-mi30x, 2026-09-05.
- **Quantized KV**: cache must track the quant scheme as part of the key, else a reuse across schemes silently produces wrong outputs.
- **Sampling**: output tokens are per-request; only the prefix KV is shared.

## Pitfalls

- **Cache invalidation boundaries.** A generated token is not shareable until committed. Don't cache output KV prematurely.
- **Tokenization drift.** Two identical-looking prompts with different BOS / chat-template can tokenize differently — match by token ID, not by string.
- **Reference leaks.** A crashed worker that held references will pin pages forever unless the scheduler has a reap path on connection loss.
- **Multi-modal tokens.** Image / audio placeholder tokens often hash to the same token ID but carry different cross-attention state; either exclude them from the key or include a content hash.
- **Prefix-cache contamination in benchmarks.** Running the same prompts back-to-back reads from cache, over-reporting TTFT by an order of magnitude. See `tooling/serving-benchmark/`.
